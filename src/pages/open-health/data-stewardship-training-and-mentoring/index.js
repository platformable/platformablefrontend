          <p>
          Mark has been an absolute joy to work with. As a young data professional, I really needed mentorship around data governance, and he provided me with that in a non-judgmental, supportive, and informed way. He's reliable and really knows what he's doing. I appreciated working with someone who was more than willing to provide me with any guidance I needed, but also reminded me of the strengths that I already had. Would recommend for anyone wanting to build their skill set around data governance and management.
